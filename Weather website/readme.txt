The full url to access my website : https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/lioann02/epl425

The only functionality that was not implemented is at the PHP GET method, i
 dont send my username and the msgs that are replied are not implemented.

No extra functionality implemented.

Also, sometimes when you open the website either it says error "ol is not defined"
or sometimes the form appears weird without any styling,
but if you refresh multiple times it will be okay.
